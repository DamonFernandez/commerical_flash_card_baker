# commerical_flash_card_baker

This is an app that allows you to write flashcards and export them as a CSV file.

To make a new flashcard you use the shortcut: ctrl + enter

To tab between fields of a flashcard use tab to go forward, and shift + tab to go back


⚠️ Saving Warning: How the saving of flashcard baker works is that whenever you type an character into any field it instantly saves it, and whenever you close the site it also saves everything this ensures that even if you close the site by accident you don't lose any progress. HOWEVER that means that you should only ever have 1 webpage of Flashcard Baker open at a time, otherwise you might accidentally overwrite the data saved.

To import it into Anki simply drag the csv file into the Anki decks screen (the default page that appears when you open Anki) and then set the separator to be commas, and choose the deck and note type you would like to use.
